# Mediainfo

Mediainfo is a class wrapping [the mediainfo CLI](http://mediainfo.sourceforge.net).

## Installation
  
    $ gem install mediainfo
  
## Usage
  
    info = Mediainfo.new "/path/to/file"
  
That will issue the system call to `mediainfo` and parse the output. 
You can specify an alternate path if necessary:
  
    Mediainfo.path = "/opt/local/bin/mediainfo"
  

Now, from this point, I bet some *actual* usage examples would be great. Unfortunately, 
I haven't really gotten around to proper documentation, yet. HOWEVER, please see the 
very reasonable test suite accompanying the source code for this library. It contains 
a bunch of relevant usage examples.

Moving on, REXML is used as the XML parser by default. If you'd like, you can 
configure Mediainfo to use Hpricot or Nokogiri instead using one of 
the following approaches:

  * define the `MEDIAINFO_XML_PARSER` environment variable to be the 
    name of the parser as you'd pass to a :gem or :require call. 
    
    e.g. `export MEDIAINFO_XML_PARSER=nokogiri`
    
  * assign to Mediainfo.xml_parser after you've loaded the gem, 
    following the same naming conventions mentioned previously.
    
    e.g. `Mediainfo.xml_parser = "hpricot"`
    

Once you've got an instance setup, you can call numerous methods to get 
a variety of information about a file. Some attributes may be present 
for some files where others are not, but any supported attribute 
should at least return `nil`.

For a list of all possible attributes supported:
  
    Mediainfo.supported_attributes
  
## Requirements

This requires at least the following version of the Mediainfo CLI:
  
    MediaInfo Command line,
    MediaInfoLib - v0.7.25
  
Previous versions of this gem(<= 0.5.1) worked against v0.7.11, which did not 
generate XML output, and is no longer supported.
